Till now what we saw is "Single expression" i.e only one statement is there. 
So, we are free to remove {}

But, now some scenario are there where we need to right more than one statement. Then we will write those code inside {}.

Que 1:
method which takes a String as argument and print its reverse. eg abcd=dcba

Que 2:
method which takes a String as argument and check if it is palindrome or not. eg level = level -	true		
					abcd != dcba = false

Que 3:
method which takes an int array as argument and return sum of all number.

Que 4:
method which takes a number as argument and return sum of all digit.

Que 5:
method which takes a number n as argument and print first n prime no.

2 ->  2,3
4 ->  2,3,5,7
5 ->  2,3,5,7,11
